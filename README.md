This project is a Python-based tool for locating the closest Whataburger stores to specified geographic coordinates. It calculates the distance between locations using the Haversine formula and identifies the nth closest store through a randomized selection algorithm, enabling efficient lookups without fully sorting the dataset. The script processes data from CSV files, reading store information from WhataburgerData.csv and handling multiple queries from queries.csv. By integrating mathematical distance calculations with randomized partitioning, this project demonstrates practical applications in geographic data analysis and efficient data handling in Python.
